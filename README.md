# THESE ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS YOU NEED TO FOLLOW IN ORDER TO RUN IT IN YOUR LOCAL COMPUTER

### INSTALLATION

1. Open cmd and type `node -v` | This is to check if you have node in your computer installed.
2. Type `npm init` to initialize the package.
3. Type `npm i express` to install all node modules in your computer.
3. type `npm i handlebars` to install the template engine to render the dynamic webpages.

### TO RUN THE SERVER

- You do not have to initalize the package because it is already there.
- `npm run **server.js**`

### I SUGGEST DO NOT USE THE REST CLIENT EXTENSION IN THE VS CODE

- Use [POSTMAN](https://www.postman.com) to execute these http request and responses.

### I SUGGEST ALSO TO USE JSON PARSE THAT FORMATS THE JSON FILE

- Preferred browser to use are browsers that uses V8 javascript engine:
    1. Chrome
    2. Edge
- Download this extension [JSON VIWER](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/djson-json-viewer-formatt/chaeijjekipecdajnijdldjjipaegdjc?hl=en-US)
